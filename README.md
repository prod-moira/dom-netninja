# Net Ninja | Javascript DOM Manipulation:
[ ] Course by Net Ninja

## 01: Vid 1 • Introduction
- DOM stands for **Document Object Model**
- It is created by the browser when a web page is loaded
- In graphical form, it looks like a tree of elements/nodes
- Programatically, we can use JS read, change, or interact with the DOM
- Added the course files (`index.html`, `styles.css`, and `app.js`)

## 02: Vid 2 • getElementById
- `document` is a built-in JavaScript object that represents the web page. You can access it directly in the browser's `Console` tab via Developer Tools.
- To select an element by its ID in the DOM, use the method `getElementById()`, passing the element's ID as a string argument.
- You can also store the selected element in a variable for easier access. For example:
    - `var banner = document.getElementById('page-banner')`
    - You can now access and interact with this variable (`banner`) through the console.
